    abstract = "The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an international millimeter/submillimeter interferometer under construction in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. ALMA will be situated on a high-altitude site at 5000 m elevation which provides excellent atmospheric transmission over most of the wavelength range of 0.3 to 3 mm. At the shortest planned wavelength and most extended configuration, the angular resolution of ALMA will be 5 milliarcseconds. This will give us the ability to, for example, image the gas kinematics in protostars and in protoplanetary disks around young Sun-like stars at a distance of 150 pc, or to image the redshifted dust continuum emission from evolving galaxies at epochs of formation as early as z = 10. The instrument will use superconducting (SIS) mixers to provide the lowest possible receiver noise contribution, and special-purpose water vapor radiometers to assist in calibration of atmospheric phase distortions. At present, the first 7 antennas have been delivered and assembled at the Operations Support Facility (OSF) at 3000 m near San Pedro de Atacama. These antennas will be assessed by ALMA engineering and science staff and then moved to the high site for commissioning. Array commissioning will begin in 2009 with fringes and phase closure amongst at least 3 fully functioning antennas at the high site, and early science observations are expected in late 2010, with full operations in 2012.",

    abstract = {{In many problems the primary data are the Fourier transform of the physical quantities which are of interest and the inverse Fourier transform is normally calculated with a digital computer. Disadvantages concerning this approach related to the presence of experimental errors in the data are pointed out and a description is presented of an alternative method of analysis based on the idea of maximum entropy. The concept is illustrated with the aid of data produced by the radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, UK. In this application the data are samples of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the radio brightness from the sky. The combination of maximum-entropy analysis with a proper treatment of experimental errors promises to be a powerful, yet safe, method for estimating the Fourier transform of incomplete and noisy data. The method is very easily generalized to deal with other types of data, not involving a Fourier transform.}},

In this report, we describe, summarize, and analyze the latest research in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

  abstract={The finding of residual gas in the large central cavity of the HD 142527 disk motivates questions regarding the origin of its non-Keplerian kinematics and possible connections with planet formation. We aim to understand the physical structure that underlies the intra-cavity gaseous flows, guided by new molecular-line data in CO(6–5) with unprecedented angular resolutions. Given the warped structure inferred from the identification of scattered-light shadows cast on the outer disk, the kinematics are consistent, to first order, with axisymmetric accretion onto the inner disk occurring at all azimuths. A steady-state accretion profile, fixed at the stellar accretion rate, explains the depth of the cavity as traced in CO isotopologues. The abrupt warp and evidence for near free-fall radial flows in HD 142527 resemble theoretical models for disk tearing, which could be driven by the reported low-mass companion, whose orbit may be contained in the plane of the inner disk. The companion’s high inclination with respect to the massive outer disk could drive Kozai oscillations over long timescales; high-eccentricity periods may perhaps account for the large cavity. While shadowing by the tilted disk could imprint an azimuthal modulation in the molecular-line maps, further observations are required to ascertain the significance of azimuthal structure in the density field inside the cavity of HD 142527.}

    abstract = "The Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) is an international millimeter/submillimeter interferometer under construction in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. ALMA will be situated on a high-altitude site at 5000 m elevation which provides excellent atmospheric transmission over most of the wavelength range of 0.3 to 3 mm. At the shortest planned wavelength and most extended configuration, the angular resolution of ALMA will be 5 milliarcseconds. This will give us the ability to, for example, image the gas kinematics in protostars and in protoplanetary disks around young Sun-like stars at a distance of 150 pc, or to image the redshifted dust continuum emission from evolving galaxies at epochs of formation as early as z = 10. The instrument will use superconducting (SIS) mixers to provide the lowest possible receiver noise contribution, and special-purpose water vapor radiometers to assist in calibration of atmospheric phase distortions. At present, the first 7 antennas have been delivered and assembled at the Operations Support Facility (OSF) at 3000 m near San Pedro de Atacama. These antennas will be assessed by ALMA engineering and science staff and then moved to the high site for commissioning. Array commissioning will begin in 2009 with fringes and phase closure amongst at least 3 fully functioning antennas at the high site, and early science observations are expected in late 2010, with full operations in 2012.",

abstract = {Given M sampled image values of an incoherent object, what can be deduced as the most likely object? Using a communication-theory model for the process of image formation, we find that the most likely object has a maximum entropy and is represented by a restoring formula that is positive and not band limited. The derivation is an adaptation to optics of a formulation by Jaynes for unbiased estimates of positive probability functions. The restoring formula is tested, via computer simulation, upon noisy images of objects consisting of random impulses. These are found to be well restored, with resolution often exceeding the Rayleigh limit and with a complete absence of spurious detail. The proviso is that the noise in each image input must not exceed about 40\% of the signal image. The restoring method is applied to experimental data consisting of line spectra. Results are consistent with those of the computer simulations.}

@article{themaxen,
    abstract = {{In many problems the primary data are the Fourier transform of the physical quantities which are of interest and the inverse Fourier transform is normally calculated with a digital computer. Disadvantages concerning this approach related to the presence of experimental errors in the data are pointed out and a description is presented of an alternative method of analysis based on the idea of maximum entropy. The concept is illustrated with the aid of data produced by the radio telescopes at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory, UK. In this application the data are samples of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of the radio brightness from the sky. The combination of maximum-entropy analysis with a proper treatment of experimental errors promises to be a powerful, yet safe, method for estimating the Fourier transform of incomplete and noisy data. The method is very easily generalized to deal with other types of data, not involving a Fourier transform.}},

We begin with the technical motivations that underlie general-purpose computation on graphics processors (GPGPU) and describe the hardware and software developments that have led to the recent interest in this field. We then aim the main body of this report at two separate audiences. First, we describe the techniques used in mapping general-purpose computation to graphics hardware. We believe these techniques will be generally useful for researchers who plan to develop the next generation of GPGPU algorithms and techniques. Second, we survey and categorize the latest developments in general-purpose application development on graphics hardware."}

abstract = "The maximum visibility of the interferences obtainable from two points in a wave field is defined as their degree of coherence γ. By a simple statistical method general formulae are found for deducing γ from illumination data. For any extended lightsource γ is found equal to the amplitude in a certain diffraction image. It does not change by the use of a condensing lens, but depends only on the aperture of the illuminating cone. These properties are applied to the microscopic observation of objects in transmitted light."
